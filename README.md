# WEATHER DASHBOARD COLLECTION SYSTEM ON AWS

WHAT ARE WE BUILDING? This project is about fetching real-time weather data for multiple cities, displaying temperature, humidity,and weather conditions. It automatically stores the data in AWS S3 bucket with timestamps for historical tracking, supporting efficient monitoring across multiple locations.

## Project Components:

- Open Weather API: Retrieves weather data for the app.
- AWS S3: Stores weather data securely in the cloud.
- Infrastructure as Code: Automates cloud setup (S3 bucket creation).
- Version Control (Git): Tracks and manages code changes.
- Python Development: Builds app logic using Python.
- Error Handling: Manages issues to keep the app running smoothly.
- Environment Management: Ensures consistent app setup across systems.

## Dependencies

- Boto3: AWS SDK for Python to interact with AWS services (e.g., S3).
- Python-dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
- Requests: Handles HTTP requests to fetch weather data.
  
## Folder Structure Of The Project

* src/: Contains the main application code.
* __init__.py: Marks the folder as a Python package.
- weather_dashboard.py: Main script for fetching weather and interacting with AWS.
- tests/: Holds test scripts for the application.
- data/: Stores any data files used or generated by the project.
- .env: Stores sensitive environment variables (e.g., API keys).
- .gitignore: Lists files/folders to exclude from version control.
- requirements.txt: Specifies project dependencies.

## Installing Dependencies
We are installing the dependencies to ensure the required libraries (boto3, requests,python-dotenv) are available for the script to run correctly.

Configuring AWS credentials to allow secure access to AWS services from my local environment.

Configuring environment variables to store the weather API key secure, and set the name of the S3 bucket. This practice separates configurations from the main code.

## Running the Python Script

python src/weather_dashboard.py to run script. We're running this script to fetch weather data, process it, and save the results to AWS S3.

Now, let's verify if the weather data is in the bucket :)

## Pushing Local Code to GitHub Repository
I now need to push all my local code from my development environment to my GitHub repository. Below are the three commands I used, along with a brief explanation of each.
1. git add .: This stages all changes to the code for commit.
2. git commit -m "message": Committed the staged changes with a message.
3. git push origin main: Pushes my local cdoe to the GitHub repositoryâ€™s main branch.
